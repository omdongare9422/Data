Step 1: Creating a Stored Procedure

This stored procedure will increase an employeeâ€™s salary based on their employee number (EMPNO).
CREATE OR REPLACE PROCEDURE IncreaseSalary (
    p_EMPNO IN Employee.EMPNO%TYPE,
    p_Increment IN Employee.SAL%TYPE
) AS
BEGIN
    UPDATE Employee
    SET SAL = SAL + p_Increment
    WHERE EMPNO = p_EMPNO;
    
    COMMIT; -- Ensures changes persist
END;


Executing the Stored Procedure
BEGIN
    IncreaseSalary(7369, 500); -- Increases SMITH's salary by 500
END;



Step 2: Creating a Function
This function calculates the total salary (SAL + COMM) of an employee.
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION GetTotalSalary (
    p_EMPNO IN Employee.EMPNO%TYPE
) RETURN NUMBER AS
    v_TotalSalary NUMBER;
BEGIN
    SELECT SAL + COALESCE(COMM, 0)
    INTO v_TotalSalary
    FROM Employee
    WHERE EMPNO = p_EMPNO;
    
    RETURN v_TotalSalary;
END;


Executing the Function
SELECT GetTotalSalary(7521) AS TotalSalary FROM dual;
